# Flower-Classifier

Welcome to my personal flowery hell that I brought to myself

This code is a combination of a youtube video which Ill link here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il8dMDlXrIE
and my best friend chatgpt helping me add features.

Here is the flower dataset:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19S90PI1hD7vkQ1rSUiC8PUbUNPM7BhTN?usp=sharing

Now to the actual code

just download the Flowers folder it (as of June 15 10:59pm PH time)
has 6 flowers that are found in the Philippines at the moment.

Run the code, and select an image that you want classified.

TBH you can also just repurpose the code not just for flowers, as long as you have the clarity to
change the following:

input_dir = r'C:\Users\Joshua\Desktop\Flowers'
to wherever you put your dataset

and

categories = ['gumamela', 'sunflower', 'tulip']
to whatever you name your folders.

It should work without a hitch.

Happy Classifying!
